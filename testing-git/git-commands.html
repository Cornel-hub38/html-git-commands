git commit -m "testing git commands"
git push origin master - "the first time you commit  ( to remote repository )"
git push - "the subsequent times you commit"
walla

git branch
git branch -b feature (create a branch called feature )
git checkout master  ( switch to master branch)
git checkout feature  ( switch to feature branch)
 ## go back unto master branch before commiting changes that are on features to master ####
git checkout master
now, type:
git merge feature master ( Remember you are currently on master branch)
 ## ( so merge is feature to master branch, while sat on the master branch)
git branch -D feature  ( delete feature branch)
